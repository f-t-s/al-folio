I'm Florian Schäfer, PhD-candidate in applied and computational
mathematics at [Caltech](http://www.caltech.edu/), where I'm doing research
at the interface of partial differential equations, statistical inference,
and fast algorithms.
More recently, I have been working on game theory as a paradigm for algorithm design and the computational challenges that come with it.
Check out these [high-level summaries](/projects/) if you want to know more!

I'm part of the [Department of Computing and Mathematical Sciences](http://www.cms.caltech.edu/)
and my PhD-advisor is [Houman Owhadi](http://users.cms.caltech.edu/~owhadi/index.htm).

Before coming to Caltech, I obtained my Bachelor's-- and Master's degrees 
in Mathematics at the [University of Bonn](https://www.mathematics.uni-bonn.de/).

I am on the academic job market this fall (2020/2021). My teaching and research statements are available upon request.
